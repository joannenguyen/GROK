                <p>GROK</p> <p>is an event unlike any other. It’s a gathering of creative people who want to connect with their peers and discuss the most pressing issues of our day.
                Instead of listening to speakers, GROK is built around group discussions called 10/20s.</p>
                <p>What are 10/20’s?</p>
                </p>10/20s are mediated discussions 
                between about a dozen participants. Any participant in a 10/20 can propose a topic for discussion.
                If the conversation is particularly 
                interesting, the session leader can extend the clock for another 10
                minutes.</p>

                    <p>If technology and music are your life, brace yourself- MOLDOVER is about to 
                    reformat your soul. Hailed by over 1,000,000 YouTube viewers as "The Godfather of Controllerism", Moldover is a new breed of music icon. Combining the charisma of a rock star, the mad genius of a basement inventor, and the radical inclusiveness of the DIY internet generation, Moldover is "literally throwing away the rule book and 
                    reinventing the wheel" (Remix Magazine). Witness his balls-to-the-wall LIVE SHOW at a club, experience one of his JAMBOX multiplayer instruments at a festival, or pick up and play the "LIGHT THEREMIN" packaging of his debut album and understand why the next paradigm for music is a one-man-brand called Moldover.</p>
